# Welcome to My Printf
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task
At this project I have to make my own printf function.

## Description
The my_printf() function produce output according to a format as described below. The my_printf() functions write output to stdout, the standard output stream. This function writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters, which are copied unchanged to the output stream and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

## Installation
At this project I have created several functions for signed decimal (d), unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), unsigned hexadecimal (x) and for pointers. Each function is executed according to the data format.

## Usage
Makefile ./my_printf
